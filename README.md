# OnTheMap

The On The Map app allows users to share their location and a URL with their fellow students. To visualize this data, On The Map uses a map with pins for location and pin annotations for student names and URLs, allowing students to place themselves "on the map," so to speak.

OnTheMap is the fourth project in the iOS Developer Nanodegree in Udacity.
